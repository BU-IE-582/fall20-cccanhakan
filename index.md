## Homework 4

NOTE: I thought that this homework was the voluntary one as there was no following homework (and counting from hw0 we may call this as the 5th one). So I did not create an html file and upload it (as i didnt want to rerun the code in knitr again). However after a conversation with a classmate I am uploading this just to be sure. Apologies for the delay.
